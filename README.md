Minimal CSS3 Loading Animations

Each loader can be called with their respective names/classes:

Heartbeat: "heartbeat"

Gooey: "gooey"

Hypno: "hypno"

Positioning is relative by default, and can be set to absolute by the user to reposition. Colors and sizes are static, but can also be modified externally.

@keyframes are cross-browser using -webkit, -moz, and static keyframes.
