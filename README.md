Minimal CSS3 Loading Animations

Each loader can be called with their respective name:

Heartbeat:
<div class="heartbeat"></div>

Gooey:
<div class="gooey"></div>

Hypno:
<div class="hypno"></div>

Positioning is relative by default, and can be set to absolute by the user to reposition. Colors and sizes are static, but can also be modified externally.
